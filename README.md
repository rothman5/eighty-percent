# Mech-Eighty v1.0
A simple 87% mechanical keyboard for hobbyists. The system is implemented using an STM32 microcontroller.
This project was used to help me learn about microcontrollers, signal integrity and manufacturing.

## Features
- Uses my external [daughter board](https://github.com/rothman5/usbc-daughter-board) for USB.
- (TODO) QMK and VIA firmware support.
- (TODO) Gasket mount using poron foam gaskets.
- (TODO) Wooden, two-piece, CNC machined case.
